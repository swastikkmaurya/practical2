Aim
To explore and comprehend Python lists, including their creation, indexing, slicing, modification, and application of key built-in functions.

Theory
In Python, a list serves as a fundamental data structure that holds multiple items within one variable. These collections are ordered, changeable, and versatile enough to accommodate diverse data types like integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.
List elements are retrieved via indexing, starting at 0 for the first item. Negative indices enable access from the list’s end. Slicing further allows pulling out specific portions of the list.
Common list operations include appending or inserting elements, merging lists with extend(), altering values directly, and leveraging functions such as len(), max(), min(), and sum() for analysis. This adaptability makes lists a staple in Python development.

Conclusion
This experiment successfully demonstrated the core features of Python lists, from creation and indexing to slicing, updating elements, and utilizing built-in functions like append(), len(), and sum(). Lists proved to be highly flexible and efficient for managing ordered collections of mixed data types. Mastering these operations lays a strong foundation for advanced data handling in programming projects and real-world applications.
